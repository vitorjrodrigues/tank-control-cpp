# JS Kernel Tank Control (C++ Version)

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler
- Joystick with two Analog Sticks and at least 3 buttons
  - Preferrably DualShock or similar
- BeagleBone Black
- Also an USB Adapter for your Joystick if it uses another standard interface

## How to Install

#### Step 1 - Downloading
- Clone the repository via terminal:
```
$>  git clone https://github.com/vitorjrodrigues/tank-control.git
```
or
- Download the directory as .zip and extract it wherever

#### Step 2 - Configuring Joystick
- Connect your Joystick
- Check if its functioning properly:
```
$> cat /dev/input/js0 | hexdump âˆ’C
```
- Copy your main computer IP address. You can do that by opening a terminal and typing (Highlight and type Ctrl+Ins to copy):
```
$> curl ipinfo.io/ip
```
- Open your main file (_JSReader.c_) and replace with that IP address whichever value is defined for _Server_IP_ (must be between double quotes)
- To compile everything on JS Reader, in your main computer, open a terminal:
```
$> cd /tank-control/JSServer
$> make
```

#### Step 3 - Configuring Client
- Open your Beaglebone via Browser:
  - 192.168.7.2 for Windows Users
  - 192.168.6.2 for Linux Users
- Open up the Cloud9 IDE
- Drag _SockClient_ folder to your Beaglebone's main folder
- Open the main file (_Client.cpp_) and replace the _Server_IP_ value with the SAME IP Address placed on _JSReader.c_
- Compile everything, by typing on your cloud9 terminal:
```
$> cd /var/lib/cloud9/SockClient 
$> make
```

#### Step 4 - Configuring Tank
- Find your L+, L-, R+ and R- motor pins
- Connect these pins on their respective Beaglebone Black pins
  - L+ on P9_14
  - L- on P9_16
  - R+ on P8_19
  - R- on P8_13 
- Find your LSPEED and RSPEED motor feedback pins
- Connect these on their respective Beaglebone Black pins
  - LSPEED on P9_15
  - RSPEED on P9_12
- Connect your Beaglebone Black to your network source (Cable or Antenna)
- Connect your power supply (not needed if connected on USB cable)

#### Step 5 - Executing Programs
- On your Computer Terminal, execute the server:
```
$> ./JSReader
```
- Follow the instructions on the screen until the server connects
- After the server is on, go to your Beaglebone's Cloud9 Terminal and execute the client:
```
$> ./Client
```
- Follow the instructions until the client connects.
- Server will tell whenever it's ready to start transmitting

#### Step 6 - Sending Commands
- With your Joystick in hands, enter _Controller Mode_
- Use Left and Right Analog Sticks to control the tank
  - Sticks can only send up and down values, meaning forwards and backwards to their respective motors
